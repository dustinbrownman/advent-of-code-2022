## Part 1

I had to take some inspiration (straight copying) from the Rust docs to figure out how to iterate over a file line by line. Luckily, I think I'll be able to use that approach for many of these puzzles. Most of the rest was figuring out how to deal with results and optionals. I was really pleased with the `parse_line` function and it's ability to tell if a line had some content or none at all.
